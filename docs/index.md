# RDM Wiki

## Hello World!

This is a wiki / knowledge base for all things related to Research Data Management. 

This is not a formal project, notes will likely be added and updated at random and will be minimally structured. It's essentially a collection of interesting links and knowledge items that can be revisited.

Moreover, information might be specific to the institution I work in (Utrecht University, The Netherlands).
